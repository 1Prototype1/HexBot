you would be right. Emma Watson is not the new Arnold Schwarzenegger. But
Arnold Schwarzenegger will forever be remembered as the old EMMA FUCKIN'
WATSON!
%
You may have thought fan idolisation such as this one has destroyed Emma
Watson's career. But a sexy actress (or actor) like her would have been
"doomed" in the professional Hollywood no matter what. Instead, Emma now is
actually relieved, and uses her earlier reputation to become a happier,
sexier, and much more productive amateur actress, who plays in roles she
considers attractive no matter how unlike her traditional Hollywood image. She
has enough self control to be pleasant and friendly most of the times, but if
you're stretching her patience, she will get a little mad and you'll be
surprised how insanely violent she can be.

Her opinions about Hollywood who gave her worse and worse treatment, not
despite the fact, but because they paid her, can be unprintable if you like
her to go that far, though she can easily be "scientific" and controlled about
that too.

Hollywood will either switch to [the amateur
model](http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html) - or implode with or without her
help and the world will be a much better, happier, productive, and even more
profitable place.
